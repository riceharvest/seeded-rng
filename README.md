## About

OpenSource Framework is a monorepo dedicated to maintaining forks of abandoned npm packages. We ensure these valuable tools continue to receive security updates, bug fixes, and compatibility improvements.

## Available Packages

| Package | Original | Status | Description |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| [@opensourceframework/next-csrf](./packages/next-csrf) | [next-csrf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-csrf) | ![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2026.svg) | CSRF protection for Next.js |
| [@opensourceframework/next-images](./packages/next-images) | [next-images](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-images) | ![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2026.svg) | Image optimization for Next.js |
| [@opensourceframework/critters](./packages/critters) | [critters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/critters) | ![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2026.svg) | CSS inlining for SSR |

## Why OpenSource Framework?

Many npm packages become abandoned over time, leaving projects vulnerable to:
- **Security vulnerabilities** - No security patches for discovered vulnerabilities
- **Compatibility issues** - No updates for new Node.js or framework versions
- **Bug persistence** - Known bugs remain unfixed
- **TypeScript gaps** - Missing or outdated type definitions

OpenSource Framework solves these problems by:
- **Active maintenance** - Regular updates and security patches
- **Community-driven** - Open to contributions and feedback
- **Transparency** - Clear provenance and changelogs for all packages
- **Quality standards** - Enforced code standards, testing, and CI/CD

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @opensourceframework/[package-name]

# Using yarn
yarn add @opensourceframework/[package-name]

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @opensourceframework/[package-name]
```

### Migration from Original Packages

Simply update your imports:

```diff
- import { something } from 'original-package';
+ import { something } from '@opensourceframework/original-package';
```
